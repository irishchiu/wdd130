    <h2>Hello, today is all about me!</h2>
    <p>Hi, I would like to start by saying that this is my first semester and that I came here straight out of high-school.
         I'm enjoying<br>
         it so far and I'm glad that I got some great roommates to help me with the transision.
         I am excited to take this class and to have<br>
         the oppurtunity to learn more about how to make a web site from scratch.</p>
    <p>A little bit about me is that I've been home-schooled since 3rd grade and that I have lived in Flordia, Georgia, Minnesota,<br>
         Alabama, and finally, Idaho. For extra-curicular activities I have done karate, taekwondo, recreational gymnastics,<br>
         and a amature parkour class.
         I was also in the Boy Scout program but I unfourtunatly was unable to get my Eagle Scout.</p>
    <p>I hope to be able to get to know all of you a better, or at least know half of your names.
        I hope that I'll be able to become friends with<br>
        some of you and that we'll be able to help each other learn(I'll need the help).
        Also, please let me know if I'm talking to much or being<br>
        intrusive and I'll do my best to fix any distruptive or unwanted behavior.</p>
